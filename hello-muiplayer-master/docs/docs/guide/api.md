# API
::: tip

mui-player.js creates the basic controls used by the player, including the progress bar defined on the player, the start/pause/full-screen switch button, and the lower part of the player head control. It handles video playback and compatibility issues.

In order to make the code has good separation module, we targeted the mobile terminal and PC terminal to develop a suitable plug out of the box, when you read this you can choose to use these two types of **extensions** of the

[mui-player-desktop-plugin.js](./mui-player-desktop-plugin/)

[mui-player-mobile.plugin.js](./plus-mobile-plugin/)

:::

mui-player.js is the core library for creating players, check the configurable api and its external interface:

- [Main configuration](#main-configuration)
- [Custom configuration](#custom-configuration)
- [Play event monitoring](#play-event-monitoring)
- [Player interface](#player-interface)



## Main configuration

From here, initialize the player instance:

```javascript
var mp = new MuiPlayer({
    container:'#mui-player',
    src:'../media/media.mp4',
    ...
});
```

## Play event monitoring

MuiPlayer manages part of the playback events, and can handle the appropriate required actions by adding a listener to the specified event. Example:

```javascript
var mp = new MuiPlayer(option);
    
// The monitor player has been created
mp.on('ready',function(event) {
    console.log(event);
});
```
